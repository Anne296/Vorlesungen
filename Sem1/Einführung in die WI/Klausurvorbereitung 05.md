## Ethics
* Refers to the principles of right and wrong
* Used by individuals to make choices that guide their behaviour

### Corporate Code of Ethics
* Collection of principles intended to guide decision making by members of the organization
* Exists in any industry (doctors, lawyers, marketing, sales, IT etc)
* Defines company values, ethics, objectives, responsibility, rules and behaviours

### Fundamental principles
* Accountability
* Responsibility
* Liability

### Issue: Personal Privacy/Information Privacy
* Personal privacy
  * Right to be left alone
* Information privacy
  * When and to what extent information about you can be gathered and distributed
* Problems
  * Electronic Surveillance
  * Personal Information in databases

## Information Security
* Refers to all of the processes and policies designed to protect an organization's information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction
### Terminology
* Threat
  * Danger to which a system **may** be exposed
* Exposure
  * Harm, loss, or damage that can result if a thread reaches an information resource
* Vulnerability
  * Possibility that the system will be harmed by a threat
### Factors Contributing to Vulnerability
* Evolution of IT
* Evolution of computer devices
* Change in Hacking Skills
* Lack of Management Support
### Threats
* Unintentional Threats
  * No malicious intent
  * Examples: Human Errors, Social Engineering
* Deliberate Threats
  * Malicious intent
  * Espionage or Trespass
  * Sabotage or Vandalism
  * Theft of Equipment or Information
  * Identity Theft
  * Software Attacks
### Causes of Human Errors
* Carelessness
* Laziness
* Lack of awareness
### Social Engineering
* Use of social skills
* Posing as a fake role
* Tailgating
* Shoulder surfing
### Protecting Information Systems
* Risk Analysis
* Risk Mitigation
* Acceptance, Limitation, Transferrence

## Software Development Lifecycle
### 1. Systems Investigation
* Starting point
* Feasibility Study
* Go/No-go Decision
### 2. Systems Analysis
* Information gathering
* Systems/User Requirements
### 3. Systems Design
* System Requirements must be frozen!
### 4. Programming & Testing
* Decision for in-house software
* Form Programming Team
* Write code
* Test throughout the whole stage
### 5. Implementaiton
* Convert from old to new system
* Requires organizational change
#### Go-Live Conversion Strategies
* Direct Conversion (Big Bang)
  * Cut old system off
  * Turn new system on
  * Least expensive, most risky
* Pilot Conversion
  * Introduce new system to one department
  * Assessed over a period of time
  * If working properly: Roll out everywhere
* Phased Conversion
  * Introduction of components of new system, e. g. modules
  * If working properly, introduce new modules
* Parallel Conversion
  * Old and new system run simultaneously for some time
  * Impractical
  * Requires double entries
### 6. Operations & Maintenance
* System Operation
  * Perform audits
  * Assess system capabilities
  * Determine system utilization
* System Maintenance
  * Debugging
  * Updates
  * Additions

## Alternative Methods for System Development
### JAD (Joint-Appl. Dev.)
* Group based tool for collectiong user requirements and creating system designs
* Mostly used in analysis and design phases
* Common meeting with analysts and users to define and agree on system
* Saves tremendous amount of time
### RAD (Rapid-Appl. Dev.)
* Combines several tools for system dev.
* Produces functional components
* Integrates the components into a high-quality system
* Iterative
### Agile Dev.
* Delivers functionality in rapid interations
* Requires frequent communication, development, testing, delivery
* Focuses on rapid development and frequent user contact
* Includes only important user needs rather than full requirements
### End-User Dev.
* Business unit users develop their own applications
* No IT assistance provided

## Projects and Project Management
### Project
* Unique
* Specific set of activities with defined goals
* Temporary (clear beginning and end)
* Must be managed to deliver on-time, on-budget, and in-scope
### Project Management
* Application of knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to project activities to meet the project requirements
* Consists of phases
  * Initiating/Defining
  * Planning
  * Executing
  * Controlling
  * Closing
### Failures
* Lack of **effective** use of IT
* Lack of **efficient** utilization of IS
