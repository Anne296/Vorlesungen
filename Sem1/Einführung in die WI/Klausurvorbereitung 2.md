## Data, Information, Knowledge
* Data management is critical to organizations
* Properly managed **data** becomes **information**, then **knowledge**
* **High quality**
* Information system help to manage data
  * Acquire, organize, store, quick and easy access, analyze, interpret
### Data
* Elementary description of things, events, activities
* Raw data

### Information
* Organized so that they have a meaning to draw conclusions
* Data with context

### Knowledge
* Consists of data/information which have been organized or processed
* Convey understanding, experience, learning to be applied to a business problem

## Difficulties in managing data
* Amount of data increases exponentially
* Multiple data sources
* Degrades over time
* Security, quality, integrity
* Duplications and inconsistencies

## Data governance
* Approach to manage information across an organization
* Involves a formal set of business processes and policies
* Designed to ensure that data are handled in a certain, well-defined fashion

### Master Data Management
* Process spanning all organizational business processes and applications
* Provides companies with the ability to store, maintain, exchange and synchronize "single version of the truth"

### Master Data vs. Transaction Data
#### Master Data
* Applied to multiple transactions
* Core data used to categorize, aggregate and evaluate transaction data
* Examples
  * Customer basic data
  * Product data
  * Vendor data
  * Location etc
#### Transaction Data
* Generated and captured by operational systems
* Describe business activities or transactions
* Examples
  * Customer, quantity
  * Product, product ID
  * Price
  * Date, time
  * Location

### Sources of data collection in organizations
* E-Mails, Web Pages, Stock Trades, Scans, Phone Msgs, Address Books, Memos, Credit Card Swipes
* Blogs, Videocasts, Podcasts, RFID tags, Wireless sensors

## Big data
* Diverse, high volume, high velocity information assets
* Require new forms of processing to enable enhanced decision making, insight discovery, process optimization
* Real Life Examples
  * Facebook
  * Google+
  * LinkedIn
  * YouTube
  * Twitter

### General information
* Management of real data is a real big problem
* Big data will continue to get bigger
* Include structured, unstructured and semi-structured data
* Cannot be stored or processed using the traditional ways and tools on hand
* Organizations have to find innovative sulutions to manage big data
* Mostly about predictions
* Probabilities based on math
* Improve themselves over time by searching for most valuable signals and patterns

### Types of Big Data
* Traditional enterprise data
	* Customer information
	* Operations data
	* General ledger data
* Machine-generated/sensor data
	* Smart meters
	* Manufacturing sensors
	* Automobils
	* Airplane engines
* Social data
	* Customer feedback
	* Twitter
	* Facebook
* Images
	* Captured by cameras

### Leveraging Big Data
* Creating transparency
* Enabling experimentation
* Segmenting population to customize actions
* Replacing/supporting human decision making with algorithms
* Innovating new business models, products, services
* Organizations can analyze far more data

## Database Management Systems
* Set of programs
* Provide users with tools to add, acces, modify, analyze data
* Data is stored in a single locatoin
* Allow effective and efficient data management
* Accessing via query and reporting tools, or a specific application
* Provides mechanisms to
	* Maintain stored data
	* Manage security and user access
	* Recover information on system failure

## File Management Systems vs Database Management Systems
* File Management Systems
	* Information silos, independent systems
	* No overall planning
	* Each application requires own data
	* Inconsistent
* Database Management Systems
	* One set of software programs
	* Provides all users with access to all data
	* Minimizes several data problems
		* Redundancy
		* Isolation
		* Inconsistency
	* Maximizes several data possibilities
		* Security
		* Integrity
		* Independence

## Explicit vs Tacit Knowledge
* Explicit knowledge
	* Objective, rational, technical
	* Consists of policies, procedures etc
	* Is codified (documented)
	* Can be transferred
* Tacit knowledge
	* Subjective, experiential
	* Experience, insights, know-how, trade secrets, skill sets
	* Unstructured, difficult to codify
	* Costly to transfer and highly personal

## Knowledge Management
* Process helping to manipulate important knowledge
* Allows organizations to make the most productive use of its accumulated knowledge

## Knowledge Management Systems
* Using modern information technologies to systematize, enhance, and expedite intra- and interfirm knowledge management

### KMS Cycle
* Create
* Capture
* Refine
* Store
* Manage
* Disseminate
